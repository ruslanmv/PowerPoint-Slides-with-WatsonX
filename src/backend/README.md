## Step 1: Set up a Python Virtual Environment
First, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then, create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.

For macOS and Linux:
```
python3 -m .venv .venv
```
then
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
For Windows:
```
python -m venv .venv
```
then
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

then

```
pip install ansible-creator  ibm-watson-machine-learning python-dotenv

```
